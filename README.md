#About -This was my second project that I had to do myself to obtain my certificate and I decided to not focus so much on the brand and products but more on the customers and their membership cards. I reported my findings on a page with in the report. I used my imagination to bring the customers to life and drove an insgiht that was more of my own idea of assuming how the business goes about membership cards, basically assuming they give cards by means of a subscription. My final analysis is on the last page in the report.
